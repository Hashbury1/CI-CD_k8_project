# CI-CD_k8_project


This repository covers a comprehensive demonstration of a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline for deploying applications to a Kubernetes cluster on AWS. It integrates various industry-standard tools to automate the entire software delivery lifecycle, from code commit to production deployment.

The project showcases a robust, scalable, and automated deployment strategy suitable for modern cloud-native applications.

## Project Goals

* To establish a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a sample application.
* To deploy the application securely and efficiently onto an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster.
* To leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform for reproducible environment provisioning.
* To demonstrate best practices for containerization (Docker) and Kubernetes deployments.
* To provide a clear, reproducible, and well-documented project for learning and reference.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes a powerful combination of tools and services:

* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub
* **Cloud Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform
* **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes (on AWS EKS)
* **CI/CD Orchestration:** [Specify your CI/CD tool here, e.g., GitHub Actions
* **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with relevant extensions
* **Application Language/Framework:** [e.g., Node.js, Terraform, Python, HTML]
